## Introduction
To analyse the freelancing market we are using the data from the platform **[Malt](https://malt.fr)** where we scrapped every freelancer profile from **(330K as of November 2023)**.<br>

You can find a detailed presentation **[here](SuperMalter.pdf)** of our analysis that shows what the best freelancer profile looks like and how you could improve yours.
<br>

We also made a **WebApp to determine your TJM** (daily rate) based on your profile and a **ML (Machine Learning Model)** that we trained on the data we scrapped.
